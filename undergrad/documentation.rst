Our project follows the MVC (Model View Controller) design paradigm. Because this pattern is so populate with web developers, many frameworks exist to help the facilitate the use of MVC in software. Cyder uses a tool called Django. Cyder uses Django's ORM (Object Relational Mapper) to communicate with a database (which is MySQL in our case, but can be another type like Postgres). Cyder also uses Django's HTTP utilities to help facilitate the use of WSGI, the python protocol used by web applications for communicating with a web-server.
